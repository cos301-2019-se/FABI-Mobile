# FABI-Mobile

In collaboration with the Institute of Commercial Forestry Research (ICFR), this project will deal with the creation of a central database or repository, as well as the development of web-based data curation portal and a mobile application for use by the South African forestry industry. This entails the implementation of a new database management system as well as both a mobile and web application. A central manager will therefore also need to be created to manage all of the databases. Due to the sensitive nature of their data, a user management system will also need to built to provide mandatory access control (MAC). The mobile and web applications will provide similar functionality, however, the web application will primarily cater for all administrative tasks. The mobile application will mainly be used by FABIâ€™s clients (forestry organizations) to submit a diagnostic clinic sample form as well as send images of the sample that they are submitting.
